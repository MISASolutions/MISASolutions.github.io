<h3><span id="home"></span>Tony Camisa, Principal/Founder MISA Solutions</h3>
<p>
I started my career, as a bench Biochemist and Molecular Biologist, working for several well known companies from large billion dollar companies to small start ups.  As a scientist I was always finding novel uses for software I wrote.  As I transitioned from scientist to engineer, I brought with me the understanding of how powerful software is as a disruptive force in the life sciences and healthcare.  Lets face it, ideas are cheap. The real work is the successful execution of these ideas.  My goal on every engagement is to provide innovative software solutions that meet budget and schedule.  My practice is currently available for engagements in several areas of life sciences, medical device, and healthcare software.

<h3>Practice focus</h3>
<p>
  My 20+ year career has been centered around collecting, storing, and visualizing data.  As both a  “Big and Small Data” practitioner, I excel at finding new markets and feature sets for data by mashing up proprietary and public data to create new context. I've worked with data across several market verticals including:
</p>
   <ul class="body">
     <li class="body"><span>The design and development of architecture, security, privacy and implementation of healthcare Internet of Things (IoT) systems.</span></li>
     <li class="body"><span>Developing bioinformatics pipelines that stitch together genotypic and phenotypic data.</span></li>
     <li class="body"><span>The integration of patient medical device results and hospital information systems (patient data).</span></li>
   </ul>

<h3><span id ="IoHT"></span>Internet of Healthcare Things</h3>
<p>
   Get operational efficiency and strategic differentiation for your product with an IoT system.  8 years of experience developing and implementing IOT strategy for Medical devices.  Expert in all aspects of the IoT software development life cycle.

<h3><span id="CustomDev"></span>Custom Software Development</h3>
<p>
  16 years of hands on software development in J2EE, C#, Perl, in both large enterprise, multi tiered systems and product console software.  My experience spans both the research and clinical lab, working on DNA sequencing, DNA/Protein array instruments, IVDs in the Chemistry, Immunoassay, Hematology, and molecular diagnostics verticals.  In addition to coding, I have experience in all the SDLC phases including:
</p>
<ul class="body">
  <li class="body">Software project planning including high level architecture, design, coding, technology roadmapping, and software component make vs buy analysis. Use of open source modules in medical devices.</li>
  <li class="body">Software requirements, user need development, verification/validation test planning, protocol development, traceability matrices.</li>
  <li class="body">Design iterations with Agile with FDA Design controls.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span id="Process_Quality"></span>Software Process and Quality</h3>
<p>
  As a software professional working for a Medical Device company for 13 years, I’m extremely comfortable with FDA 21 CFR Part 820 and Part 11 and ISO 14971.  I have built customized  design control process for software only products. Other areas I can help your software development organization are:
</p>
<ul class="body">
  <li class="body">Quantifying Software quality.</li>
  <li class="body">Improvement of Code reviews.</li>
  <li class="body">Risk Analysis, Failure mode effects analysis.</li>
  <li class="body">Conversion of “research use only” systems to medical devices.</li>
  <li class="body">Use of Cloud solutions in medical devices</li>
</ul>

<h3><span id="Security"></span>Software Security</h3>
<p>
  Healthcare IT systems are under siege.  As a result, Security and privacy is paramount.  As a developer, getting these systems deployed at the customer site involves a huge effort answering questions about the security and privacy features of the product, its development and operational environment.  As the ,<u>Information Security Officer for outward facing products</u> I did just that.  Some examples of successful projects that I developed and executed as ISO:
</p>
<ul class="body">
  <li class="body">Developing a strategy for medical device whitelisting.  Drove technology assessment, vendor selection, contract negotiation, and implementation to all medical devices.</li>
  <li class="body">Contributor to Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute’s Auto 11-2A “Information Technology Security of In Vitro Diagnostics Instruments and Software Systems.”</li>
  <li class="body">Obtained Air Force ATO through the DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process.</li>
  <li class="body">Updating SDLC Process documentation to include new Security and privacy recommendations including, security coding standards, Architecture and design, Code reviews, testing, and deployment.</li>
  <li class="body">Provided evidence for FDA guidance on Cybersecurity for a IVD 510K submissions.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span id="BioInfo"></span>Bioinformatics</h3>

<ul class="body">
  <li class="body"><span>Data analysis pipelines</span></li>
  <li class="body"><span>LIMS development, Deployment</span></li>
  <li class="body"><span>Data visualizations, Business Intelligence</span></li>
  <li class="body"><span>Multi-node Computational and storage Server / Application operation strategy</span></li>
